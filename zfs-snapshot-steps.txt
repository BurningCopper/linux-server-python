Steps to perform a check:
1. Grab a list of snapshots on remote system
    ssh <hostname> zfs list -t snapshot -o name <volume_name>
2. Reduce list to the most recent daily snapshot
    use grep module to reduce list to only 'daily' snapshots
    use the last item on the list as the last snapshot name
3. Grab list of snapshots on local filesystem
    zfs list -t snapshot -o name <volume_name>
4. Reduce list to the most recent daily snapshot
    use grep module to reduce list to only 'daily' snapshots
    use the last item on the list as the current snapshot name
5. verify that current snapshot is older than last snapshot
    simple if statement with > sign?
6. Transfer the snapshot
    ssh <hostname> zfs send -i <old_snapshot> <last_snapshot> | zfs recv <volume_name>
7. Email a report to me

Setup:
1. Have zfs permissions set for the user name on both systems
2. setup passwordless ssh login for the local user on the remote system
